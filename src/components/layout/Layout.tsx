Since I don't have the original content of `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` in the provided files, I can't provide the full code with the necessary modifications. The AI mentioned that Layout.tsx was a read-only file and couldn't be modified directly.

To properly fix the issue, you would need to ensure there's a navigation link to the "/reels" route in your layout component. Without seeing the original file, I can't provide the complete code with the necessary changes.

If you can provide the content of `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`, I would be able to create the full code with the proper navigation link to the Reels page.
